# Print your first line of code

#Print the shape from above
print("*")
print("**")
print("***")
print("****")

#Now what happends if we change the form will it still print the same form?
print("*")
print("****")
print("***")
print("**")

#As you can see the order does not stay the same as the begining and this is because 
#The Python interpreter will read lines of code sequentially, starting with the first line of code
#Lines at the top of your code execute before lines at the bottom of your code
