# Welcome to Fishing Simulator

A client who is thinking on buying a fishing business has asked for a simulation of revenues or losses. The client understands that his business needs to be productive and as such he will fish different species every year. He know that he will start with lobsters than with Kelp, then Urchins then Kelp and back to Lobsters. 

Each species brings different revenues. The key is understanding that there are probabilities of higher success in selling the product at a higher price or taking a loss depending on the season. The following helps understand said probabilities and revenues/losses:

<p1>
    
Lobsters:
    <ul>
    <li>Option 1: 10% chance: excellent yield; the diving operation earns $125,000.</li>
    <li>Option 2: 70% chance: moderate yield; the diving operation earns $50,000.</li>
    <li>Option 3: 20% chance: poor yield; the diving operation loses $10,000.</li>
    </ul>
    
Kelp:
    <ul>
    <li>Option 1: 60% chance: good yield; the diving operation earns $45,000.</li>
    <li>Option 2: 40% chance: poor yield; the diving operation loses $10,000.</li>
    </ul>
Urchins:
    <ul>
    <li>Option 1: 75% chance: good yield; the diving operation earns $30,000.</li>
    <li>Option 2: 25% chance: poor yield; the diving operation loses $5,000.</li>
    </ul>
</p1>

At the end of the simulation the user is provided with the result showing one of the three options:
<ol>
<li>If at the end of the year the total is negative meaning losses the owner will sell the business.</li>  
<li>Over $325,000 in total profit. The owner happily retires.</li> 
<li>Five consecutive years of positive profit. The owner happily retires.</li> 
</ol>
The owner can run as many simulations as they wish!
