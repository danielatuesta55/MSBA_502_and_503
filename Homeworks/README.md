This unique tool will allow you to analyze galaxies, planets, and their planetary incomes. Here are the steps you need to follow to get your results:
1. When prompted please enter you name
2. Enter the number of galaxies you would like to analyze
3. The number of plantes in each of the galaxies
4. The income of the planet in each galaxy

If you follow the steps correctly you will see the final output display the number of galaxies you chose the number of total planets and who many their are on average on each galaxy. You will also see the average planetary income and average galactic income. Furthermore, you will also see the income distribution of the galaxy!

# Welcome to Fishing Simulator

A client who is thinking on buying a fishing business has asked for a simulation of revenues or losses. The client understands that his business needs to be productive and as such he will fish different species every year. He know that he will start with lobsters than with Kelp, then Urchins then Kelp and back to Lobsters. 

Each species brings different revenues. The key is understanding that there are probabilities of higher success in selling the product at a higher price or taking a loss depending on the season. The following helps undertand said probabilities and revenues/losses:

<p1>
    
Lobsters:
    <ul>
    <li>Option 1: 10% chance: excellent yield; the diving operation earns $125,000.</li>
    <li>Option 2: 70% chance: moderate yield; the diving operation earns $50,000.</li>
    <li>Option 3: 20% chance: poor yield; the diving operation loses $10,000.</li>
    </ul>
    
Kelp:
    <ul>
    <li>Option 1: 60% chance: good yield; the diving operation earns $45,000.</li>
    <li>Option 2: 40% chance: poor yield; the diving operation loses $10,000.</li>
    </ul>
Urchins:
    <ul>
    <li>Option 1: 75% chance: good yield; the diving operation earns $30,000.</li>
    <li>Option 2: 25% chance: poor yield; the diving operation loses $5,000.</li>
    </ul>
</p1>

At the end of the simulation the user is provided with the result showing one of the three options:
<ol>
<li>If at the end of the year the total is negative meaning losses the owner will sell the business.</li>  
<li>Over $325,000 in total profit. The owner happily retires.</li> 
<li>Five consecutive years of positive profit. The owner happily retires.</li> 
</ol>
The owner can run as many simulations as they wish! 

<h5 align="center">Good luck and may the odd be forever in your favour.</h5>
