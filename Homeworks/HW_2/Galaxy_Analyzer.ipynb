    "This unique tool will allow you to analyze galaxies, planets, and their planetary incomes. Here are the steps you need to follow to get your results:\n",
    "1. When prompted please enter you name\n",
    "2. Enter the number of galaxies you would like to analyze\n",
    "3. The number of plantes in each of the galaxies\n",
    "4. The income of the planet in each galaxy\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "If you follow the steps correctly you will see the final output display the number of galaxies you chose the number of total planets and who many their are on average on each galaxy. You will also see the average planetary income and average galactic income. Furthermore, you will also see the income distribution of the galaxy! \n",
