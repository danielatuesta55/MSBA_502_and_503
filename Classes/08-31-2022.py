""" Variables in python 

A variable is a container tat we can use to store values

Each variable has a unique name so that we can find, read, or update its value

Example:
"""

text = "Hello, world!"
motto = "Python is cool."
print(text,motto)

#Important to note that the teacher likes the syntax to be word_word_word make sure all your code is written in this format
