# Print your first line of code
print("Hello, world!")

# Print the following in the console
"""
*
**
*** 
****

"""
#Print the shape from above
print("*")
print("**")
print("***")
print("****")

#Now what happends if we change the form will it still print the same form?
print("*")
print("****")
print("***")
print("**")

#As you can see the order does not stay the same as the begining and this is because 
#The Python interpreter will read lines of code sequentially, starting with the first line of code
#Lines at the top of your code execute before lines at the bottom of your code

#Variables

# A variable is a container that we can use to store values
# Each variable has unique name so that we can find, read, or update its value
#Here is an example of a variable 

text = "Hello, world!"
print(text) #Here we use the print statement to display in the console our variable text

#Assignment refers to giving a variable a value, which we indicate with an equal sign:
text = "Hello, world!"
motto = "Python is cool"

print(text, motto)#The order in which you tell it to print will be how its printed. So in this case hello world is the first thing printed.
